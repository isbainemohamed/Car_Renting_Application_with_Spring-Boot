# Car Renting Application with Spring-Boot
This is a Spring Boot web application. The main goal was to practice with:
  - JPA
  - H2 / My sql
  - MVC

# Objective : 
The car rental management system can be used by companies that manage a car rental project, note that this project only runs on a local machine, 
but can be modified to run on multiple machines simultaneously for more high efficiency and to serve the whole company.
